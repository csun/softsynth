Instructions for building & use of SoftSynth.

Building:

	To build this project on your own system, you need to download the JUCE
	framework and the Projucer. The Projucer is a program developed by JUCE
	that allows you to export projects into the IDE of your choice. While 
	this is a downside to using the framework, it makes the running of JUCE
	code on different platforms very straightforward. 

Running the binary:
	
	The binary can be built on Windows, Mac, and Linux systems, and we will 
	include binaries for each platform with the final submission. 

Instructions for use:
		
	If you wish to use your own MIDI controller, it should be plugged in
	and turned on before launching the program, otherwise, it will not 
	be recognized. If you do not have a MIDI controller, it will default
	to the computer keyboard to control the synthesizer.
