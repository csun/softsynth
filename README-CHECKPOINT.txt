Project description:
We plan to make a software synthesizer plugin that can be used as an instrument in music production software.


Major Features Implemented:
Make a synth that you can control using a GUI
Make different modes that have different sounds and options
JUCE GUI that shows the keyboard and the sounds of the synth


Major Features Remaining:
Import the sounds the user makes into music editing software like Ableton
Make different modes sound better than they do now and add more of them
More user manipulation of the sound
User be able to actually play a USB keyboard


Unexpected Complications:
We haven’t really faced any complications thus far. We were successful with implementing the midi, gui, and sound sliders pretty easily. We haven’t decided to change anything from the original proposal.
